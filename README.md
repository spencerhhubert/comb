# comb
for combing through input,target data

## requirements
- iterate over input-target pairs of text
- highlight desired text to keep from either side (maybe just have text boxes where I can delete undesired sections)
- insert additional text from the user
    - more reason text box is just the best option
- "next" and "repeat" which both save the current pair, but the repeat sets the current item to the next item
- inputs-target pairs might need to be split up into smaller chunks. need to be able to do more than one iteration on a single pair
- function to compile all the pairs into a giant json

## how make
- js that can save through regular save file button
- python to update the js file with the data needing labelling
